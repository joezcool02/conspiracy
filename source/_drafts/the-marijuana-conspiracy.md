{% asset_img marijuana.jpg The Future %}

The government would like us to believe that marijuana is unsafe. Marijuana is not hurtful to the human body or psyche. Marijuana is not a risk to the people but it is a risk to oil organizations, liquor, tobacco commercial ventures and an extensive number of synthetic companies. These are huge organizations, with a huge amount of dollars and impact. People in power have suppressed the truth from the people. 0 people have died from smoking 'Weed' so far so why's there such a negative stigma associated with it? Why does a metaphorical stink follow those who partake.

Actually, if marijuana was utilised and exploited as the natural resource that it is, it would cause a huge shift in the power dynamic of society. 

### Marijuana through history

Where did the word ‘marijuana’ come from? In the mid 1930s, the M-word was created to tarnish the good image and phenomenal history of the hemp plant – as you will read. The facts cited here, with references, are generally verifiable in the Encyclopedia Britannica which was printed on hemp paper for 150 years :

1) All schoolbooks were made from hemp or flax paper until the 1880s. (Jack Frazier. Hemp Paper Reconsidered. 1974.)

2) It was legal to pay taxes with hemp in America from 1631 until the early 1800s. (LA Times. Aug. 12, 1981.)

3) Refusing to grow hemp in America during the 17th and 18th centuries was against the law! You could be jailed in Virginia for refusing to grow hemp from 1763 to 1769 (G. M. Herdon. Hemp in Colonial Virginia).

4) George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and other founding fathers grew hemp. (Washington and Jefferson Diaries. Jefferson smuggled hemp seeds from China to France then to America.)

5) Benjamin Franklin owned one of the first paper mills in America, and it processed hemp. Also, the War of 1812 was fought over hemp. Napoleon wanted to cut off Moscow’s export to England. (Jack Herer. Emperor Wears No Clothes.)

6) For thousands of years, 90% of all ships’ sails and rope were made from hemp. The word ‘canvas’ is Dutch for cannabis. (Webster’s New World Dictionary.)

7) 80% of all textiles, fabrics, clothes, linen, drapes, bed sheets, etc.,were made from hemp until the 1820s, with the introduction of the cotton gin.

8) The first Bibles, maps, charts, Betsy Ross’s flag, the first drafts of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were made from hemp. (U.S. Government Archives.)

9) The first crop grown in many states was hemp. 1850 was a peak year for Kentucky producing 40,000 tons.Hemp was the largest cash crop until the 20th century. (State Archives.)

10) Oldest known records of hemp farming go back 5000 years in China, although hemp industrialization probably goes back to ancient Egypt.

{% blockquote Popular Mechanics, February 1938 %}
“It has a short growing season… It can be grown in any state… The long roots penetrate and break the soil to leave it in perfect condition for the next year’s crop. The dense shock of leaves, 8 to 12 feet above the ground, chokes out weeds. …Hemp, this new crop can add immeasurably to American agriculture and industry.” In the 1930s, innovations in farm machinery would have caused an industrial revolution when applied to hemp. This single resource could have created millions of new jobs generating thousands of quality products. Hemp, if not made illegal, would have brought America out of the Great Depression.

### The Conspiracy

{% asset_img weed-vs-tobacco.jpg Legal Vs Illegal %}

People are finally beginning to wake up to the benefits of Marijuana. Medical marijuana is legal in the majority of states now, with Colorado making $70 million in taxes in 2015 alone, but why isn't big business fighting this?. 

A great way to increase the demand and therefore cost of a product in economic theory is to make it an inelastic good, and one way the government seems incredibly versed at creating inelastic goods is by making them illegal. Recreational drugs are sterotypically incredibly expensive for the production costs in making them. Peoare aware of these costs and they are ramped up due to the alleged 'risk' of production and dealing. So take these ramped up prices and turn the product into something that only the government can elgally sell and you are looking at what is happening right now across the USA with marijuana, the people are asking for it and the governs painting themselves as the good guys by finally allowing us to purchase this good at the same prices from before. But what happens next? Why doesn't the government try the same things with more addicting drugs, they seem to have nothing to lose. And who is to say they haven't already got their hands in the pockets of drug cartels.

In fact it would seem that the government is using California and Colorado as a testing ground to introduce weed at a federal level because the Tobacco industry is trying to lever legal weed to turn around the downward trend of Tobacco by making smoking fashionable again. By allowing weed to the worlds film capital but denying it elswhere cigarette sales are being pushed and no-one can see it. The Tobacco industry is trying to use its biggest enemy to further their agenda. Too many people in this day will turn up their nose to Tobacco and big Tobacco knows this, they need to jump ship and this green herb is the same color as the money in their eyes.
