#### Who is Shia?

Shia LaBeouf (henceforth referred to as Shia) is a name that many people will have heard before. Shia rose to fame as the Louis Stevens in the TV show Even Stevens and later starred in the new Transformers franchise.

### Shia La Breakdown
Shia has been a controversial figure in Hollywood since the end of the filming of Even Stevens. Shia has been constantly seeking attention through stunts for years. It seems likely that Shia is simply a character invented by the actor Louis Stevens when he began to fade into obscurity. Many other actors have attempted similiar things, Rowan Atkinson invented "Mr Bean", Leigh Francis invented "Keith Lemmon" but none have gone to the level of 'Shia' who publicly denies that he was ever known as Louis Stevens.

### But why?

Shia's, or should we say Louis' stunts have created a lot of free publicity for his films and career. A notable example was his supposedly impromptu video which was accidentally infront of a green screen, do you think this was a coincidence?

The character Shia LaBeouf also appeared in another viral video "Actual Cannibal Shia LaBeouf" in 2012 which could be the turning point at which the actor fully embraced the Shia LaBeouf identity.

These 'breakdowns' and publicity stunts have pushed his career past what could possibly have been attained as Louis Stevens. This is known as the "Miley Cyrus Factor". Stevens is not the first to try this and certainly wont be that last... but can we really blame him?
