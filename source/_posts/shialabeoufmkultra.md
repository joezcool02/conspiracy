### Shia La Breakdown
Shia has been a controversial figure in hollywood since the end of the filming of Even Stevens. Shia has been constantly seeking attention through stunts for years. 
It seems likely that Shia is simply a character invented by the actor Louis Stevens when he began to fade into obscurity. 
Many other actors have attempted similiar things, Rowan Atkinson invented "Mr Bean", Leigh Francis invented "Leigh Francis" but none have gone to the level of 'Shia' who even went as far as to edit wikipedia and IMDB credits as to create the facade that Louis Stevens was a character played by Shia, rather than the other way around.

### But why?

Shia's, or should we say Louis' stunts have created a lot of free publicity for his films and career. A notable example was his supposedly impromptu video which was accidentally infront of a green screen, this quickly went viral as it was very easy to edit and create new versions.

The character Shia LaBeouf also appeared in another viral video "Actual Cannibal Shia LaBeouf" in 2012 which could be the turning point at which the actor fully embraced the Shia LaBeouf identity.

These 'breakdowns' and publicity stunts have pushed his career past what could possibly have been attained as Louis Stevens. This is known as the "Miley Cyrus Factor". Stevens is not the first to try this and certainly wont be that last...
