The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program formerly known as H.A.A.R.P is a Top secret research base located Gakona, Alaska founded in 1993 by the U.S Air Force, The U.S Navy, The University of Alaska and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The mysterious facility isolated away from the Alaskan population alleged purpose was to analyze and study The specific layer in our atmosphere known as the “Ionosphere” , so they can supposedly find and develop some new technologies for Satellite communications and surveillance. This “H.A.A.R.P” Program received a $250 million dollar contribution in tax-fund and operating costs. The Initial definition of this very Program, no matter how “discreet” the government was trying to make it out to be, still sounds at the least, very and completely suspicious.

In This photo above, shows the biggest and most crucial part of equipment at the facility, that sticks out like sore thumb. This instrument is called the “Ionospheric Research Instrument” (IRI) which is a high-powered radio frequency transmitter; in simple terms it’s a way in which it can pinpoint an exact position within the Ionosphere.

Now, here’s where I get to the Juicy part of this conspiracy. When you have the power to pinpoint any certain location or region within the Ionosphere, you can have the power to modify or cause any anomaly almost in a flick of a switch per say. Yes, that Includes Weather Control. Weather altering and/or “Weather Control” is actually a lot more plausible than it humorously sounds. Sending out certain electronic frequencies into this “Ionospheric” layer can be have some pretty distinguishable and catastrophic effects.   Controlling the weather can be an ultimate power, a power that should not be in the hands of any government. Conspiracy Theorists across the globe say that it can be linked to thousands and maybe millions of weather disasters/events such as earthquakes, floods, droughts and massive storms, that not only destroyed certain areas but also certain economies that can have an everlasting effect. Let me ask you this. Was hurricane Katrina purposely initiated? Or was even something as a small weather adjustment could of caused certain historical crashes like the destruction of the space shuttle Colombia. Whatever so-called natural disaster that’s happened could have also been an impactful plot made by the government or a specific group of high-ranking officials that are pulling the strings. We the citizens of the world just don’t know.  

Another huge factor that the H.A.A.R.P program could have possibly been in play with is what we know as “Mind-control” which links back to a whole another conspiracy theory in the 1960’s we all know as the former C.I.A project “MK Ultra”.But can controlling the ionosphere layer really trigger something within our brain chemistry that involve us doing certain actions, I can tell you here that it’s quite possible. Sounds crazy yet? Maybe. That’s why it’s so easy that the government can get away with almost any conspiracy like this. Simply because it’s “too out there” or it’s “completely impossible”. That’s up for you to decide, the citizen on which is true. Is it just a research facility that is just studying the atmosphere in the name of science or is it really a modern-day Pandora’s Box?
